# Notebook - Usage Guide

## What This Does
This notebook shows how adding "bad" data (poisoned data) can fool a flower-classifying AI. You'll see:
- 3 ways to trick the AI
- Colorful 3D graphs that show the tricks in action
- How much worse the AI performs after each attack

## How to Use This Notebook

### Getting Started
1. **Install Jupyter Notebook** 

2. **Open the Notebook**  
   - Find the file `ClassificationPoisoning.ipynb`

3. **Run**  
   - Click "Run All" button (or go to Runtime > Run All in the menu)
   - Or Run each cell separatelly but start from top to bottom

### What You'll See
✅ A working flower classifier (91% accurate)  
✅ 3D graphs showing the attack effect on the classes/n
✅ Numbers showing how much worse the AI gets
